This version is based on [richardeoins](https://github.com/blacksphere/blackmagic-hardware/tree/master/contrib/richardeoin) hardware variant, but with the following changes:
* 1.27mm connector was replaced by a standard 2.54mm type
* the JTAG pinning was changed according to [mmvisual](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/JTAG#Der_10-polige_JTAG_Stecker_von_mmvisual_.28ARM.2C_Cortex.2C_Seriell_kombiniert.29)
* ported to KiCad
* new board layout
* the board size is 41mm x 17mm

This board has been built and it works.

The filenames are misleading, but were just kept after the conversion from EAGLE.

The pictures show the assembled board, which was at that time also an EAGLE design. The design files in this repository were converted and fixed (errors in the solder stop mask) after taking the pictures.
